# Problem Statement: Tech-Driven Solutions to Address the Dual Threat of Paper Cups

## Challenge Overview
Disposable paper cups are not only a major contributor to environmental degradation but also pose significant health risks. Most disposable paper cups contain harmful chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which can leach into beverages and act as carcinogens, increasing the risk of cancer. Despite increased awareness about these issues, the reliance on disposable paper cups at cafeterias, events, and social gatherings remains alarmingly high.

This hackathon challenges participants to design and develop tech-based solutions that educate the community about these pressing health and environmental concerns, promote sustainable alternatives, and inspire behavioral change through innovative coding and creative problem-solving.
